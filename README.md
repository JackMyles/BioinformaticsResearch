# Bioinformatics Research Project in the Myles Lab, Department of Entomology, Texas A&M University
The project focused on analyzing small RNAs derived from dengue viruses in mosquitoes. Graduate students and postdocs in the lab infected the mosquitoes with these pathogens. From these, they then prepared libraries that were sent off for sequencing. A postdoc in the lab ran the sequence data that is returned through a bioinformatic analysis pipeline. However, the output of the programs needed to be visualized further, both for additional analysis and for presentation as figures. My role was to develop Python programs for this purpose. I developed five different programs that produce various histograms from the output files. I also created a text based interface enabling anyone to create the histograms without needing to understand the code. Additionally, I learned to run the bioinformatic analysis pipeline so the data visualization could be seamlessly integrated into the data output process.
